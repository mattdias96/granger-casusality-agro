This project was coauthoed with Sahil Kulkarni as a final project for the class Stats 307 at Stanford. We use the concept of Granger Causality for Linear and Non-Linear Models to understand the relationship between Agricultural Output Prices and the Number of Forest Fires in Brazil. 

In this Repo, you will find the code I used for the Neural Granger Causality part of the paper. The code was forked from the original paper's Github (https://github.com/iancovert/Neural-GC) by Ian Covert et al. and has a few changes that I needed to do to optimize the MLP for my dataset and objective. The final paper can be found on the "Final Paper.pdf" file and I am also leaving a link for a short medium post about it (https://matheusdias-50631.medium.com/uncovering-the-hidden-connection-between-forest-fires-and-agricultural-markets-b1ff0db42b06).
